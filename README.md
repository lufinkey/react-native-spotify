# Spotify for React Native

A react native module for the Spotify SDK

**NOTE:** This repo is using the deprecated Spotify streaming SDKs. I have been told by users that it is now no longer functional, since Spotify has [turned off the API](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2022/07/15/mobile-streaming-sdks-update/).

[react-native-spotify-remote](https://github.com/cjam/react-native-spotify-remote) is being worked on by [cjam](https://github.com/cjam) to use the newer "remote" SDK.

## Install

To add the Spotify SDK to your project, cd into your project directory and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install --save rn-spotify-sdk
react-native link react-native-events
react-native link rn-spotify-sdk
```

Next, do the manual setup for each platform:

#### iOS
Manually add `SpotifyMetadata.framework` and `SpotifyAudioPlayback.framework` from `node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Linked Frameworks and Libraries* in your project settings. Then add `../node_modules/rn-spotify-sdk/ios/external/SpotifySDK` to *Framework Search Paths* in your project settings.

#### Android

Edit `android/build.gradle` and add `flatDir`

```
...
allprojects {
	repositories {
		mavenLocal()
		jcenter()
		maven {
			// All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
			url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
		}
		flatDir {
			dirs project(':rn-spotify-sdk').file('libs'), 'libs'
		}
	}
}
...
```

Edit `android/app/build.gradle` and add `packagingOptions`

```
...
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
    }
}
packagingOptions {
    pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libgnustl_shared.so'
    pickFirst 'lib/x86/libgnustl_shared.so'
    exclude 'lib/arm64-v8a/libgnustl_shared.so'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/libgnustl_shared.so'
}
...
```

In some cases, the two `exclude` lines cause issues when compiling and can be omitted. I need to look further into what causes this.

On Android, `react-native link` has a bug where it imports `RNSpotifyPackage` using the wrong bundle. You may have to make the following change to `MainApplication.java`:
```java
...
import com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication.RNSpotifyPackage; // remove this line
import com.lufinkey.react.spotify.RNSpotifyPackage; // replace with this line
...
```

If you have issues linking the module, please check that gradle is updated to the latest version and that your project is synced. Please reference the [example app](example) to ensure you've implemented things correctly before opening any issues.

import Spotify from 'rn-spotify-sdk';

### Events

This module uses [react-native-events](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-events), so it has all of the same methods as an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) object. All of the events except for **'disconnect'** / **'reconnect'** (on Android) and **'login'** / **'logout'** come from Spotify's native SDK and are simply forwarded to javascript. If one of these events occurs at a weird time or has strange data, please open an issue on Spotify's [ios-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/ios-streaming-sdk) or [android-streaming-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/android-streaming-sdk) repo, and not here.

- **'login'**

	- `session` {Session}
	
	Emitted when the module has successfully logged in.

- **'logout'**

	Emitted when the module is logged out.

- **'sessionRenewed'**

	- `session` {Session}
	
	Emitted when the session has been renewed.

- **'play'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when playback has started or has resumed.

- **'pause'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when playback is paused.

- **'trackChange'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when playback of a new/different track starts.

- **'metadataChange'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when metadata has changed. This event occurs when playback starts or changes to a different context, when a track switch occurs, etc. This is an informational event that does not require action, but should be used to keep the UI display updated with the latest metadata information.

- **'contextChange'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when playback starts or changes to a different context than was playing before, such as a change in album or playlist.

- **'shuffleStatusChange'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when "shuffle" is switched on or off.

- **'repeatStatusChange'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when "repeat" is switched on or off.

- **'active'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when this device has become the active playback device. This event occurs when the users moves playback to this device using Spotify Connect.

- **'inactive'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when this device is no longer the active playback device. This event occurs when the user moves playback to a different device using Spotify Connect.

- **'permissionLost'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when this device has temporarily lost permission to stream audio from Spotify. A user can only stream audio on one of her devices at any given time. If playback is started on a different device, this event may occur.

- **'audioFlush'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when the application should flush its audio buffers (you don't need to deal with this since that's handled by the native code). For example, this event occurs when seeking to a different position within a track.

- **'audioDeliveryDone'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when the library reaches the end of a playback context and has no more audio to deliver.

- **'trackDelivered'**

	- `event` {PlaybackEvent}
	
	Emitted when the application accepted all samples from the current track. This is an informative event that indicates that all samples from the current track have been delivered to and accepted by the application. The track has not yet finished playing the last audio sample, but no more audio will be delivered for this track. For nearly all intents and purposes, the track has finished playing.

- **'disconnect'**

	Emitted when the player loses network connectivity.

- **'reconnect'**

	Emitted when the player regains network connectivity.

- **'temporaryPlayerError'**

	Emitted when service has been interrupted, usually by lack of network access. However, it can also occur if there is a problem with Spotify's backend services, or also when the user switches from WiFi to 3G. These errors can occur in many non-critical situations, and thus it is not necessary to show toasts or alert dialogs when receiving this event, or else you will unnecessarily annoy or panic the user. However, it can be useful to know about these events if operations are consistently failing, in which case showing a toast or alert may be justified.

- **'playerMessage'**

	- `message` {String}
	
	Called when the player has recieved a message for the end user from the Spotify service.

### Token swap and refresh

In order for your app to stay logged into Spotify for more than an hour, you must set up your own server with endpoints for token swap and refresh, and specify your `tokenSwapURL` and `tokenRefreshURL` parameters in the `Spotify.initialize` method

The `tokenSwapURL` parameter is used to swap the authentication code provided by the Spotify login process for an access token and a refresh token.

The `tokenRefreshURL` parameter is used to retrieve new access tokens for the user using the refresh token received from the `tokenSwapURL`.

Both URLs are queried using POST with a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

You can find an example server implementation [here](https://github.com/lufinkey/react-native-spotify/tree/master/example-server).

Refresh tokens are part of [OAuth standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5). If you are not familiar with them, [Understanding Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/refresh-tokens/) can give you a basic idea on how they work.
